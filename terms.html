				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
				</br>
				<h2>Terms &amp; Conditions</h2> <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Alexander Ershov.</p>
				<p>Alexander Ershov is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right
					to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its
					services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
				<p>
By accessing, receiving, downloading, syncing, using, or possessing OR continuing to access, receive, download, sync, use or possess software, toolbars, user interfaces, applications and associated media ("Software") for use on mobile devices, via the internet, submitting a profile information, or clicking the "I Agree" or "Continue" buttons when prompted and completing the profile information, Subscriber (referenced also as "you") is entering into this Agreement with UVI Mate, and Subscriber hereby acknowledges and agrees to the validity and applicability of the Terms and Conditions governing this Application, the Privacy Statement, any applicable Subscription Terms and Provider Terms, and agrees to be bound hereto. The Products are available only to individuals that have the capacity to create a binding legal obligation regarding your use of the Application and by accessing this Application, all users represent that this requirement is met.
				</p>
				<p>The UV Index Now - UVI Mate app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my Service.
					It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or
					root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating
					system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security
					features and it could mean that the UV Index Now - UVI Mate app won’t work properly or at all. </p>
				<p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Alexander Ershov will not take responsibility for.
					Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi,
					 or provided by your mobile network provider, but Alexander Ershov cannot take responsibility for the app not
					 working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>

				<p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile
					network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
				<p>Along the same lines, Alexander Ershov cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make
					sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Alexander
					Ershov cannot accept responsibility</p>
				<p>With respect to Alexander Ershov’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear
					in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to
					provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Alexander Ershov accepts no liability for any loss,
					direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
				<p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android and iOS – the requirements for
					 both systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll
					 need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Alexander Ershov does not promise that it will always
					 update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS/Android version that you have installed on your
					 device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop
					 providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell
					 you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must
					 stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>

	<p><strong>Fees</strong></p>
	<p>Please be advised that some, but not all, areas of the
	Application may contain fee-based services, and are subject to additional Buying in-app purchases(IAP) in our iOS app. </p>
